## What is the name of your App?
A.I. SPY
<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
A.I. SPY is a mobile-optimized party game designed for 4 players. The object of the game is to be the last player standing.

At the start of the game, each player and 1 A.I. agent, powered by GPT-3, are given unique identities. Each player - including the A.I. - proceed to select another player to ask a question to. Once each player has asked a question, players vote on the player they would like to eliminate (either because they think the player is the A.I. or simply a threat to themselves).

This gameplay continues until 1 human remains or the A.I. remains the lone victor ðŸ˜Ž
